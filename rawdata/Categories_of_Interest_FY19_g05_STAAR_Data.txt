DATA ANALYSIS 

Data from 2019 STAAR Mathematics testing comprises 4326 Rows and 3145 Columns.
Rows are for individual schools and columns are for specific categories and criteria.
Below I have considered specific columns of data that comprise important categories for analysis according to our criteria and questions.

Questions:
1. Are there statistically significant difference between District Schools and Charter Schools in student performance?
2. Are these differences or lack-of-differences present in the demographics of the student population?
3. Are there correlation between student performance, school type, and important student metrics including economic factors,
migrant status, special education, gifted-and-talented status, and at-risk status?

To address these questions, we can extract these data from the 2019 STAAR Test Data in the categories identified below. To consider the
questions proposed, the following data analysis plan is suggested:

1. STAAR Categories are 'Did Not Meet Grade Level', 'Approaches Grade Level', 'Meets Grade Level', and 'Masters Grade Level.' These
categories will be given numerical scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
2. The percentage of students in each STAAR Category will be used to calculate a mean and standard deviation for the student population
in each school. Assuming 100 students, each percentage will equal the number of students with that STAAR category score. Statistics are
calculated based on the number of students in each score category (i.e. 30% of students achieving Category 3 score will have 30 values of 3 
for the mean and standard deviation calculations).
NOTE: These data are NOT the same as a mean and standard deviation based on individual data for each student member of 
the school population, but are the best estimate of these actual mean and standard deviation data given the STAAR Test Data available.
3. These data can be used to compare the population of district and charter schools.
4. The same numerical analyses can be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for students based on demographic and racial,
economic advantaged/disadvantaged, migrant, homeless, special education, gifted-and-talented, and at-risk classifications. These data
will be used to compare district and charter school performance across these categories. These data can be compared to overall performance 
within each school, and also may be used for comparison across schools and student classifications.

LIMITATIONS:
1. The data are focused on mathematics. Equivalent analyses for reading and science are feasible, but beyond the scope of this study. These
data are available in these datasets.
2. The statistical treatments of data are not at the individual student level, so estimation of student statistics from STAAR data is necessary.
3. The underlying causes and correlations are beyond the scope of this study. However, the analyses presented in this study are focused on 
the questions delineated above, which may also suggest future studies.
